# Text Classification using Stack Overflow Posts
This is repository for NLP course assignment 2.

## Overview
In this project, we developed an unsupervised text classification algorithm to categorize Stack Overflow posts related to NLP topics into 12 categories, labeled based on common steps in language model development. The process includes data collection from Stack Overflow, text preprocessing, EDA, topic modeling to evaluate text semantic relationships, classification algorithm development, and evaluation. 

The classification was done by comparing the performance of two clustering strategies: a traditional rule-based model and a more modern approach using cosine similarity with embeddings. This exploration was conducted to identify the most effective approach for handling text data containing technical terms and natural language.

The end-to-end process of this project is documented in our notebook named `a1915688_a1941816_Notebook_assign2.ipynb`.
